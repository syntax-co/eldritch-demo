Piloting an Automata is a constant source of stress and danger. 
As you use these machines to fight against the Horrors and Seraphs, 
you will need to keep your Stress and Stability under control. 
Interpersonal relationships and drama are also key elements of Eldritch 
Automata. You must navigate complex alliances and rivalries with other 
survivors as your relationships cause ripples through the world around you.
