Welcome to the dark and dangerous world of Eldritch Automata. 
Designed in the Year Zero Engine and inspired by the likes of Neon 
Genesis Evangelion, Pacific Rim, and Escaflowne, E//A takes place 
in a recent-apocalyptic world filled with horror, drama, and psychological 
torment. In Eldritch Automata, you play one of humanity’s last defenders, 
facing down eldritch abominations that want to eat you, controlled by 
visually perfect angelic beings that want to control you, while piloting a 
massive monstrosity of a mech, the titular Automata, that’s slowly killing you
